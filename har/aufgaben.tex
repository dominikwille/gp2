\section{Exercises}
\subsection*{Exercise 1}
Investigation of free undamped oscillations. Measuring the amplitude as a function of time. Determining the system's damping constant \(\delta\) and eigenfrequency \(\omega_0\).
\subsection*{Exercise 2}
Investigation of forced oscillations. Recording the amplitude as a function of time. Determining the damping constant and the eigenfrequency.
\subsection*{Exercise 3}
Qualitative observation of the phase shift \(\phi\) between exciter an oscillator as a function of the exciter's frequency \(\Omega\).
\subsection*{Exercise 4}
Observation of the swing behaviour for the resonance case and for an excitation frequency \(\Omega\) close to the resonance frequency \(\omega_0\).
