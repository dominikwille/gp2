\section{List of Equipment}
To get an experimental compare to the theoretical equations of motion the following Equipment is used:
\begin{itemize}
\item The swing device is an torsional harmonic oscillator which has a flywheel at the end of the spring.
\item The Angular of the wheel is measured by an Angular to Voltage Converter which is connected to an PC-Oscilloscope. The coupling of the two wheels is realized by just using a small rope between the wheels.
\item The evaluation of the detected signals is made with the CASSY-Lab-software on the spot. 
\end{itemize}
