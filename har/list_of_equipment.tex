\section{List of Equipment}
To get an experimental compare to the theoretical equations of motion the following Equipment is used:
\begin{itemize}
\item The swing device is an torsional harmonic oscillator which has a flywheel at the end of the spring.
\item The Angular of the wheel is measured by an Angular to Voltage Converter which is connected to an PC-Oscilloscope. The coupling of the two wheels is realized by just using a small rope between the wheels.
\item The evaluation of the detected signals is made with the CASSY-Lab-software on the spot.
\item To get a friction which is mainly dependent on the wheels velocity a eddy-current break is used. The current which flows through the coil is  scalable in 4 steps. Therefore there are 4 possible damping constants (\(\delta_0, \delta_1, \delta_1, \delta_3 \)). 
\item There is a small electric motor to drive the oscillator. The motor is powered
by a DC power supply and can be regulated by a potentiometer.
\end{itemize}
